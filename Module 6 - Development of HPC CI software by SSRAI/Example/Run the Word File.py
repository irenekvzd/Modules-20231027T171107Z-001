# 1. Introduction
def introduction():
    content = """
    This module discusses the robust software development techniques for High Performance Computing (HPC) deployment of intelligent systems. 
    The importance of adhering to good software development practices is magnified when addressing threats and vulnerabilities associated with intelligent systems 
    because the risks posed by compromised A.I. are substantial. As High-Performance Computing (HPC) plays a key role in any area of computation, 
    software development is no exception.

    The goal of this module is to present the learner with techniques and concepts that will aid in the development of safe, secure, and reliable A.I. software. 
    An emphasis is placed on the importance of secure development, the detection of flaws and issues, and the reduction of the probability of a system breach or collapse.

    IBM Research defines software development as a set of computer science activities dedicated to the process of creating, designing, deploying, and supporting software. 
    The software development process can be split up into 6 distinct stages. These stages are sometimes referred to as the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

    Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
    Step 1: Planning / Requirement Analysis
    Planning is arguably the most important phase of the SDLC. Creating a well-thought-out plan is fundamental to the process of creating safe, secure, and reliable software 
    because it lays the groundwork for all other steps of the development life cycle. Planning is typically performed by a senior member of the software development team, 
    preferably with input from all parties involved. This means the project lead should integrate information from management, marketing, sales, domain experts, engineers, 
    customers, etc., into the design plan.

    Step 2: Defining Requirements
    After the needs of the project have been clearly established, the next step involves clearly defining and documenting exactly what is expected of the software development team. 
    After the requirements of the project have been documented through an SRS (Software Requirement Specification) document, they should be signed off by the customer or the market 
    analysts depending on the nature of the project.

    Step 3: Designing the Product Architecture
    The SRS should be used by those involved in product architecture design to create multiple DDS (Design Document Specification) plans that will be presented to important stakeholders 
    to review. The DDS should be measured on qualities like robustness, modularity, budget and time constraints, level of risk, and technical feasibility.

    Stage 4: Development
    The first three stages are all essentially planning stages with increasing levels of precision, or articulacy. In the fourth stage of the SDLC the product is built by a developer or 
    team of developers per the selected DDS. If the first three stages are executed at a high level, this stage should be relatively easy.

    Stage 5: Product Testing
    This stage is dedicated to the testing of the product prototype produced by the development team. Any issues with the product are documented, tracked, and reported back to the dev team 
    so they can be fixed. This process is repeated until the product meets the SRS.

    Stage 6: Deployment and Maintenance
    After the product has been tested and revised thoroughly, the product is ready for deployment. Deployment may occur incrementally, or all at once, depending on the needs of the customer/user. 
    Incremental deployments or beta testing allows for customer validation. Feedback from beta testing gives developers the chance to fix issues that might have been missed during the fifth stage. 
    After the product is completely deployed, the product will be maintained for the user base. Periodic updates for bug fixes, general improvements, or new features are a necessary part of any sustained system.

# 2.1 Key Features of Software Development
def key_features():
    content = """
    Key Features of Software Development:

    Artificial Intelligence: AI systems that use neural networks, machine learning, natural language processing, and other cognitive-like capabilities help developers to offer innovative 
    software development. AI-based software accelerates software deployment, quality, and efficacy.

    Cloud-based development: Software development organizations use cloud computing services to improve resource management and provide fast and cost-efficient IDE. Usually cloud-based 
    development environments support all process phases of the software development process like coding, designing, integrating, and testing.

    Blockchain: Blockchain has extensive application in many areas because of its security features. Regardless of the industry or application, blockchain can transform the processes of many 
    technologies. In the software development area, the number of blockchain-oriented applications has increased due to its features that ensure the security of data.

# 2.2 Software Development Tools and Solutions
def development_tools():
    content = """
    Software Development Tools and Solutions:

    1. GitHub: is the leading software development platform. GitHub provides an environment to store projects, codes, collaborative repository hosting service, and you have choice to make it public 
       or private web-based service.

    2. Git: is software for tracking changes in files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, 
       data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

    3. Jira: is one of the first software development tools used by agile development by many organizations. Jira helps a lot when software development comes to project management, for example, 
       for planning, tracking, customizing the workflow, and collaboration.

    4. Sublime Text: is a text editor environment for code. Sublime allows you to change codes easily and switch between projects very fast.

    5. Slack: is an environment that helps to share information, tools that are used between a group of people. Slack helps to reduce back and forth daily emails and increases the quality of communications 
       between different teams of a company.
