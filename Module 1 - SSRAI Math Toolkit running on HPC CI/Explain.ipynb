    "The SSRAI (Statistical and Scientific Research Artificial Intelligence) Math Toolkit is a suite of mathematical and statistical tools designed to run on High-Performance Computing (HPC) Cyberinfrastructure (CI). Below is an example of how the SSRAI Math Toolkit might be used in an HPC CI environment for large-scale data analysis and modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Large-Scale Climate Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "To perform a comprehensive statistical analysis of climate data to identify trends and patterns that could help in predicting future climate changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection:**\n",
    "   - Collect climate data from various sources such as satellites, weather stations, and ocean buoys. This data includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Preprocessing:**\n",
    "   - Use the SSRAI Math Toolkit to clean and preprocess the data. This involves handling missing values, normalizing data, and performing initial exploratory data analysis (EDA).\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from ssrai_math_toolkit import DataPreprocessor\n",
    "\n",
    "   data_preprocessor = DataPreprocessor()\n",
    "   cleaned_data = data_preprocessor.clean(data)\n",
    "   normalized_data = data_preprocessor.normalize(cleaned_data)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Statistical Analysis:**\n",
    "   - Perform various statistical analyses using the toolkit. For example, calculate mean, median, standard deviation, and perform hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from ssrai_math_toolkit import Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "   stats = Statistics()\n",
    "   mean_temp = stats.mean(normalized_data['temperature'])\n",
    "   std_temp = stats.std(normalized_data['temperature'])\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Advanced Modeling:**\n",
    "   - Use machine learning and statistical models to identify trends and make predictions. The SSRAI Math Toolkit can interface with popular ML libraries to build and evaluate models.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from ssrai_math_toolkit import MLModel\n",
    "   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
    "   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\n",
    "\n",
    "   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(normalized_data.drop('target', axis=1), normalized_data['target'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n",
    "\n",
    "   model = MLModel(RandomForestRegressor())\n",
    "   model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "   predictions = model.predict(X_test)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **High-Performance Computing:**\n",
    "   - Scale the computations using HPC resources. This involves parallelizing the tasks and utilizing the CI's computational power to handle large datasets and complex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from hpc_ci import HPCCluster\n",
    "\n",
    "   cluster = HPCCluster()\n",
    "   cluster.run(data_preprocessor.clean, data)\n",
    "   cluster.run(stats.mean, normalized_data['temperature'])\n",
    "   cluster.run(model.fit, X_train, y_train)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Results Analysis:**\n",
    "   - Analyze the results to derive insights. Visualize the trends and predictions using the toolkit's visualization capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from ssrai_math_toolkit import Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "   viz = Visualization()\n",
    "   viz.plot(predictions, y_test, title=\"Predicted vs Actual Temperature\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Reporting:**\n",
    "   - Generate comprehensive reports of the findings, including statistical summaries, model performance metrics, and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from ssrai_math_toolkit import ReportGenerator\n",
    "\n",
    "   report = ReportGenerator()\n",
    "   report.add_section(\"Statistical Summary\", stats.summary(normalized_data))\n",
    "   report.add_section(\"Model Performance\", model.performance_metrics())\n",
    "   report.add_section(\"Visualizations\", viz.get_plots())\n",
    "   report.generate(\"Climate_Data_Analysis_Report.pdf\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "Using the SSRAI Math Toolkit running on HPC CI allows researchers to efficiently preprocess, analyze, and model large-scale climate data. The combination of advanced statistical methods and the computational power of HPC enables more accurate predictions and deeper insights into climate patterns."
